# Cortex Agent — Multi-Agent Architecture Diagrams

Interactive visual diagrams explaining how Cortex's autonomous DeFi trading system works on Solana.

## What's Inside

### Architecture Overview (8 Cards)
- Hero — Autonomous DeFi Execution on Solana
- Phase 01 — Real-Time Data Fusion (Pyth, Birdeye, Helius, Raydium, Drift, Cross-Protocol)
- Phase 02 — Markov Regime Switching (5 regimes + proactive vs reactive)
- Phase 03 — 4 Specialist Agents (Momentum, Mean-Reversion, Liquidity, Arbitrage)
- Phase 04 — Adversarial Validation (2 researchers debate before execution)
- Phase 05 — Dynamic Orchestration (capital allocation per regime)
- Phase 06 — Execution Layer (Raydium, Orca, Jupiter)
- Complete Flow — 6-step summary

### Crash Scenario + Metrics (3 Cards)
- Hypothetical: SOL -40% in 6 hours — Cortex (-7%) vs Jupiter Bot (-100%) vs Drift (-25%) vs Kamino (-20%)
- On-Chain Metrics Dashboard — 6 data streams with live signal indicators
- Market Asymmetry — slow climb vs fast crash + 4 early warning signals
